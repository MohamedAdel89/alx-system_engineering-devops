Postmortem Beating Scholarships

Issue Summary
After days and months of brainstorming, our team decided to create a website just for scholarships where we upload scholarship openings because we noticed how people loved scholarships so we created a website for the consumption of the general public. We tested it, made sure it was working and then soon after we made it known on our social media platforms knowing that we had eased the burden of the general public pertaining to scholarships. At about 4:50 PM GMT to 5:30 PM GMT, we noticed that we started trending on social media with people coming in with funny comments and how that our site was frustrating people. We thought we were helping ease the burden not knowing frustration had set in and about 59 people slid into our dms informing us that our site was malfunctioning. To our surprise, we checked and truthfully we couldnt access it ourselves. We took a critical look at the problem and we noticed where we went wrong.
